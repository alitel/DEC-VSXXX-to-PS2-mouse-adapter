DEC VSXXX serial mouse to PS/2 mouse adapter
--------------------------------------------

The DEC VSXXX-AA (hockey puck/Hawley) and VSXXX-GA serial mice used on some 90s DEC workstations are increasingly hard and expensive to come by.
This project aims to provide instructions to build a (reasonably) cheap alternative adapter allowing the use of a PS/2 mouse with certain DEC vax and alpha workstatoins.
In my case, I have a VAXstation 3100 and a DEC 3000 AXP machine, so I have created both the adapter and cables to connect it to both machines. Both systems work well.

This project is a personal adaptation to the work already done by David Kuder. All credit for the design goes to them. Their work can be found at:
