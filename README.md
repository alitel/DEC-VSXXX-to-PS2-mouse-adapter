DEC VSXXX serial mouse to PS/2 mouse adapter
--------------------------------------------

The DEC VSXXX-AA (hockey puck/Hawley) and VSXXX-GA sesrial mice are increasingly hard and expensive to come by.

This project is an adaptation to the work already done by David Kuder at https://hackaday.io/project/19576-dec-mouse-adapter.
